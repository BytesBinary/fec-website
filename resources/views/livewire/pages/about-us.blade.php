        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
            The idea of establishing an engineering college in Faridpur emerged from the growing need for specialized education in the western region of Bangladesh. Recognizing the demand for engineers in a developing economy, the government allocated resources to create a state-of-the-art institution dedicated to technical education. From its inception, Faridpur Engineering College was envisioned as a center for academic and practical excellence, adhering to both national and international educational standards.Initially, the college started with three major undergraduate programs: Civil Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), and Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). These disciplines were selected based on their relevance to the industrial and infrastructural needs of the country.
